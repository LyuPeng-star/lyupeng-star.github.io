Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio. My name is **Peng Lyu (ÂëÇÈµ¨, Ïó¨Î¥â)**, and I am a PhD candidate in Artificial Intelligence at Jeonju University, South Korea. My research is dedicated to making AI systems more transparent, interpretable, and efficient.

This project is more than a digital CV; it's a practical showcase of my skills in modern web development and a canvas for my creative expression.

## üöÄ Building a Portfolio Like This: A Step-by-Step Guide

Ever wanted to build a similar portfolio for yourself? It's more straightforward than you might think. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the process and the tools I used.

### üõ†Ô∏è Step 0: The Toolkit (Prerequisites)

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

* **Node.js**: [Download the LTS version here](https://nodejs.org/)
* **Git**: [Download here](https://git-scm.com/)
* **A Code Editor**: I highly recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### üè† Step 1: Initialise the Project with Next.js

Next.js is a powerful React framework that makes bootstrapping and deploying projects remarkably simple. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-portfolio
```

During the setup, you will be prompted with several options. I recommend the following configuration:

* `Would you like to use TypeScript?` **Yes** (Essential for robust, type-safe code.)
* `Would you like to use ESLint?` **Yes** (Keeps the codebase clean and consistent.)
* `Would you like to use Tailwind CSS?` **Yes** (The core tool for our styling.)
* `Would you like to use 'src/' directory?` **Yes** (For better project organisation.)
* `Would you like to use App Router?` **Yes** (The latest and recommended routing system.)

### üé® Step 2: Sculpting the UI with Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows you to build sophisticated designs directly within your markup.

* **Gathering Inspiration**: Before writing any code, it‚Äôs wise to sketch out your ideas, perhaps using tools like [Figma](https://www.figma.com/). Websites like [Awwwards](https://www.awwwards.com/) and [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/) are excellent sources of inspiration.
* **Component Construction**: Break down your design into logical components (e.g., Header, Profile Section, Footer). Then, assemble them using `div`s and Tailwind's utility classes (`bg-gray-900`, `text-white`, `flex`, etc.).

### üé¨ Step 3: Adding Animation with Framer Motion

Static sites can feel a bit lifeless. Framer Motion is a wonderfully simple yet production-ready animation library for React.

1. **Installation**:
    ```bash
    npm install framer-motion
    ```
2. **Implementation**:
    Simply replace a standard `<div>` with `<motion.div>` and declare animations using props like `initial`, `animate`, and `whileHover`. For instance, to make an element fade and scale into view:
    ```jsx
    import { motion } from 'framer-motion';
    
    <motion.div
      initial={{ opacity: 0, scale: 0.8 }}
      animate={{ opacity: 1, scale: 1 }}
      transition={{ duration: 0.8 }}
    >
      Hello, World!
    </motion.div>
    ```

### üß© Step 4: Creating Your Signature Components

The soul of a personal portfolio lies in its unique, custom-built components.

* **The World Clock**: As demonstrated in this project, combining React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) with clever CSS like `group-hover` can produce elegant, interactive elements.
* **Academic Cards**: Use Flexbox or CSS Grid to beautifully organise your publications, research interests, and other academic achievements.

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Step 5: One-Click Deployment with Vercel

Vercel is the creator of Next.js, making it the natural choice for seamless, zero-configuration deployments. It‚Äôs also free for personal projects.

1. **Push to GitHub**: Ensure your project is a GitHub repository and that you have pushed all your latest changes.
2. **Import to Vercel**: Visit the [Vercel website](https://vercel.com/), sign in with your GitHub account, and select 'Add New... -\> Project'.
3. **Select Your Repository**: Choose the GitHub repository you just pushed and click 'Import'.
4. **Deploy**: Vercel automatically detects that it's a Next.js project. No configuration is needed. Simply click 'Deploy'. Within minutes, your website will be live on a global CDN. Better still, Vercel enables Continuous Deployment: every time you push a change to your `main` branch, your live site is updated automatically.
